Buffer Overflow Python Scripts

Those scripts are made for my **THM Buffer Overflow Prep**.

- *000_crash.py* is made to find the threshold. (empiricism w/ the payload)
- *001_finding_eip.py* is made to find the offset.
- *002_eip_overwrite.py*
- *003_find_bad_characters.py* is made to find the bad characters. (look for the bad_chars)
- *004_jmp.py*
- *005_shellcode.py* is made for the netcat listening.
